# Network Policy Default Don't Allow Ingress

## Description

Network policies control traffic flow between Pods, namespaces, and external IP addresses. By default, no network
policies are applied to Pods or namespaces, resulting in unrestricted ingress and egress traffic within the Pod network.
Pods become isolated through a network policy that applies to the Pod or the Podâ€™s namespace. Once a Pod is selected in
a network policy, it rejects any connections that are not specifically allowed by any applicable policy object.

## Rationale

Administrators should use a default policy selecting all Pods to deny all ingress and egress traffic and ensure any
unselected Pods are isolated.

A policy with 'allow all' would override this default and should not be used.
